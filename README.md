### Hi there 👋

I'm currently doing some kind of 'agile coach/advisor' things for tech companies in Japan as a freelancer.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have interested in, anytime via [twitter DM](https://twitter.com/kakutani), [facebook messages](https://fb.me/kakutani) or else. Needles to say, I can read/write Japanse well.
